    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>International Electronics and Technical Institute (IETI), Inc. was established in July 1974 in Taft Ave, Pasay City. IETI Pasay offered one and two- year courses in Electronics. In 1975, IETI opened schools in Cubao and Makati. IETI Makati is still located at Guadalupe Commercial Complex (GCC) and initially offered courses in Electronics, Electricity, Radio Communications, Refrigeration, Automotive, Typing and Stenography. IETI Cubao, was located at EDSA corner New York St. offered courses in Electronics specializing in Radio and Television. In 1981, IETI Schools offered the course two-year (2-yr) Electronic Computer Technician (ECT) course earning the distinction of being the first private school in the Philippines to offer such a program. In 1984, IETI Caloocan was opened in Caloocan City, near the Bonifacio Monument and offered courses in Electronics and Radio Communications (ERC). A new two-year (2 yr) course was introduced also in 1984 in all IETI Schools, the Industrial Electronics Technician (IET).

In Academic Year (AY) 1985-86, IETI applied with the Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS) for a Trimestral School Calendar which was pilot tested for two (2) years. Eventually, the Trimestral School Calendar was institutionalized in AY1987-88.
space
In Academic Year (AY) 1986-87, the two year (2 yr) Electrical, Refrigeration and Airconditioning Technician (ERTA) was offered in all the IETI schools, this is IETI ‘s answer to the call for a technician-level education in related fields of electricity and refrigeration.
